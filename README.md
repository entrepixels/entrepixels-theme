Entrepixels theme is a Liferay 6.2 theme with site template embebed very useful for corporative pages.

This theme only uses one "theme setting" to configure if you want to show the link to access as login user
   - show-access: type checkbox. Default value = true (show or hide the access link in header)

If you want see a full example with all posibilities that the theme offers we recomend you create a new site as Entrepixels-theme site template in the control panel. In this way you will have a full site with many pages where you can see many examples of use.
